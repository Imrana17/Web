            I copied the HTML and CSS code from the moving colourful wheel from freecode camp to host.
            I successfully hosted the colourful wheel on tiiny host and posted my link in the group as exhibition. 
            But my friend by the name <b>'Malam Ahmed Abdul-Rauf'</b> told me that the colourful wheel is not marketable enough, 
            i should rather do some form or logins. Then i was convined that i have to change the colourful wheel to a registration form. 
            I went on copy the HTML and CSS of the registration form o n freecode camp, then with the aid of AI and some skills i have gathered from youTube and freecode camp. 
            I change the whole colouring from Head to toes and hosted it on Github.com.</p><br>
