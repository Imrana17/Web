            This webpage consists of an HTML form for user registration and corresponding CSS styles for layout and presentation. The HTML structure starts with the DOCTYPE declaration, followed by an html tag containing the entire webpage content. The registration form has an h1 heading, p tag, and form element with attributes for submission method and action URL. Form fields are grouped using fieldset elements, and input fields include text, email, password, number, file, radio, select, and textarea. A checkbox and submit button ensure users accept terms and conditions before submitting. CSS styles define body font family, background color, headings, paragraphs, form elements, labels, input fields, radio buttons, checkbox, submit button, and responsive media query for smaller screens.<br>
